# iOS Proficiency Exercise
Create a universal iOS app using Swift \
Ingests a json feed from https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json \
You can use a third party json parser to parse this if desired. \
The feed contains a title and a list of rows \
Displays the content (including image, title and description) in a table \
The title in the navbar should be updated from the json \
Each row should be the right height to display its own content and no taller. No content should be clipped. This means some rows will be larger than others. \
Loads the images lazily \
Donâ€™t download them all at once, but only as needed \
Refresh function \
Either place a refresh button or use pull down to refresh. \
Should not block UI when loading the data from the json feed.
